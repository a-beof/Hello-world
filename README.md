# Hello-world
Just another depository.

Greetings!

My names Andrew, and I am completely new to all of this. I like to take long walks to the fridge and have an obsessive passion over fitness. I am powered up by coffee and doughnuts and will be learning coding with my little genin apprentice jr padawan. Coding is something we both want to learn and are willing to take the necessary time needed to master this skill. We are both grateful for this opportunity given by this website. Wish us good luck!
